<p><strong>Part 1:</strong>&nbsp;Use this sample web page. <a href="https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week5-jquery-examples/blob/master/lab-5-q2.html">https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week5-jquery-examples/blob/master/lab-5-q1.html</a></p>
<p>Use JQuery selectors to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the page loads, make the &lt;span&gt; elements bold &nbsp;</li>
<li>When the &lt;h2&gt; elements are clicked on, give them a green background (or another color of your choice)</li>
<li>Make the&nbsp;&lt;p&gt; elements disappear when you hover over them with the mouse. They should appear when the mouse moves away.</li>
<li>When the id="h1_blue" button is clicked, make all of the H1 elements blue. (or another color of your choice)</li>
<li>When the id="remove_not_important" button is clicked, remove the li items with class = "not_important"</li>
<li>When the items in the unordered list are clicked, make them slide away or fade out.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part 1: To Do list in JQuery</strong></p>
<p>Create a web page with an empty list, and an input box. You will use this to create a to do list. When you type something in the input box, it will be added to the to do list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decide on one style to represent items that are not done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Decide on another style to represent items that you have done; which will be list elements with the 'done' class. &nbsp;For example, you could use&nbsp;<span>text-decoration</span>: <span>line-through</span><span>; &nbsp;to put a line through the text. Or, another style of your choice.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p>Create a CSS stylesheet with one style for regular list items, and a different style for list items with the class 'done'.</p>
<p>When you click on one of your&nbsp;list items, it should toggle between done and not done. You should use the toggleClass method to add or remove the 'done' class; so that the appropriate CSS style is applied.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong></p>
<p>Add a button to remove the items you have done. When you click the button, all of the list items that have the class 'done' will be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: To Do List, move&nbsp;done items:</strong></p>
<p>Modify so that when you click the remove button, remove this list item (or items); and add a row to a table on the same page. The new row will have the text of the item in one column, and the date that you marked it done in the second column.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: To Do List Animation:</strong></p>
<p>Use the fade, or slide, or animate functions to animate the list items being deleted from the list and being added to the table.</p>
